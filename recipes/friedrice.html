    <h3>
      Nigerian Fried Rice is a very simple yet delicious recipe. This version
      relies on a ton of fresh vegetables, Beef Liver, and a little bit of oil
      for crisping it up.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The added beef liver gives the fried Rice a very nice rich but subtle
      taste, and this is why it is one of the most popular choices in Nigeria.
      Though you can also use Shrimp or any protein you’d like. If you would
      love to make vegan fried rice, you can omit the Beef liver or Shrimps
      entirely!
