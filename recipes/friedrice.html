    <h3>
      Egusi is a West African name for the seeds of plants like squash, melons,
      and gourds that, when dried and ground become a staple ingredient in many
      West African dishes. Particularly, in Nigerian culture, egusi is popular
      with pounded yam. These seeds are rich in fat and protein, and add these
      essential nutrients into West African Cuisine.
